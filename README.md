# 📊 Bakery Sales Analysis 

This project showcases a full-year sales analysis of a bakery, based on 10,840 cleaned and structured transactions. The main goal was to turn raw data into clear visual insights, using UX/UI design principles to improve user experience and readability.

## 📅 Data Period 
- Start: **2019-07-11 15:35** 
- End: **2020-06-18 14:52** 
- Total sales after cleaning: **10,840 transactions** 

## 🔍 Key Insights 

### 🥖 Top-Selling Products 
- **Sweet bean bread** is the absolute top seller. 
- **Croissant, plain bread, and tiramisu croissant** also perform well. 
- Products with very low sales (e.g., tiramisu, lemonade) may need reevaluation.
